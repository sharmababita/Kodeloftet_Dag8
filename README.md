JavaScript, a programming language that provides functionality to websites. JavaScript is used to make web pages dynamic and interactive by handling user actions, manipulating HTML content, refreshing the page without reloading it, and creating animations. In addition, JavaScript can handle data in real time. It is one of the three basic languages ​​in web development, along with HTML and CSS. JavaScript can interact with both HTML and CSS to change content, as well as send and receive data that is recorded on the website.

Linking:
<script></script> in <head> where we can write JS directly in the HTML document
<script src="name.js"></script>
<script type="module" src="name.js"></script> in <head> where we link to an external JavaScript file. Must have the keyword defer to tell the browser to read through the html file before reading the javascript file.
<script src="navn.js"></script> in <body> where we link to an external JavaScript file. Important to always have the script element at the bottom of the body element so that the browser will read all the html elements before moving on to javascript
Variables:
let is a variable that can be changed after it is assigned a value.
const is a variable that cannot be changed after it is assigned, but the value it contains can be changed for mutable data types.
Primitive data types:
string represents text and is surrounded by either single (' ') or double (" ") wildcards.
number represents a number, either an integer or a decimal number.
boolean represents either true or false.
Non-primitive data types: (which we did not go through today, but can be mentioned as data types)
function is a block of code that can be called using the function name.
array is a collection of elements, and each element has a numeric index starting from 0.
object is also a collection, but the elements are key-value pairs, where the keys are strings (or symbols), and the values ​​can be of any data type.
Remember that JavaScript is a flexible language, and there are always small nuances and exceptions.
